## Psychology Research Projects 

[**Self-Regulation and Procrastination: A New Treatment (completed on April 30th, 2025)**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hHCCx75SgTgRTbaIS7xKagfLGG5-remc/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115946607884560544016&rtpof=true&sd=true)

* For this dissertation project, I developed a novel intervention to help students reduce procrastination by enhancing self-regulation. I tested the intervention on first-year psychology students. Specifically, I compared the submission times of lab reports between students who received the intervention and those who did not. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control condition and completed the corresponding task via a Qualtrics survey. Participants completed a follow-up survey later in the semester to collect data on lab report submission times. An independent samples t-test was conducted in SPSS to determine whether there is a significant difference in the average submission date between the two groups. This analysis revealed that there was no difference between the submission dates for the two groups. My findings were written into a lab report and delivered to a panel audience. 


**Does guided imagery of meaningful places alleviate state anxiety and improve mood? (January 8th, 2025)**  

* This research project will be presented as a [poster](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hHCCx75SgTgRTbaIS7xKagfLGG5-remc/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115946607884560544016&rtpof=true&sd=true) at the American Psychological Association conference on August 7th. 

* This study investigated the effects of guided imagery on anxiety and mood in university students with anxiety. Guided imagery involves using an audio recording to lead participants through imagining vivid sensory experiences. The aim was to examine the effects of imagining an urban place versus a natural place, and a personally meaningful place versus a neutral place. We hypothesized that imagining meaningful places, particularly natural ones, would have a greater impact on anxiety and mood than imagining neutral places.

* Methodology: Participants completed surveys measuring positive mood, negative mood, and state anxiety before and after the guided imagery task. Quantitative data from these surveys were analyzed using linear mixed-effects modeling in SPSS. Participants also responded to open-ended questions about their experiences, and qualitative data from these responses were analyzed using template analysis.

* Results: Results indicated that state anxiety and negative affect decreased significantly in all conditions. However, imagining a neutral place significantly reduced positive affect, while both meaningful conditions had no such effect. Qualitative analysis revealed themes of present focus, quieter thoughts, and distraction from stress, as well as challenges completing the neutral place condition.

* Conclusion: These findings did not support the hypothesis that imagining meaningful natural places would yield the greatest effects on state anxiety and mood. This suggests that the therapeutic effects on state anxiety and negative affect may stem from the guided imagery task itself rather than the type of imagined place.

## Data Science Projects 

[**COVID-19 Data Visualization (March 6th, 2025)**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iCFzlUV6_f3x_OPRluk7g0FTgm5R7HgL?usp=sharing)  

* In this project, I explored and visualized COVID-19 data, including vaccination rates, infection rates, and death counts. I used Pandas to summarize the data with descriptive statistics and applied Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize trends and identify patterns. The visualizations revealed that Western European countries had higher mortality rates than Eastern European countries, and that the United States had the highest number of active COVID-19 cases in the Americas. These insights suggest that future research should investigate differences in healthcare systems, policies, and other factors that may contribute to these trends.

[**SQL for Epidemiology (February 18th, 2025)**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Yvm1C0Kf2UpUrJtIVUjgzXXAHHItxsnB?usp=sharing)

* In this project, I analyzed a COVID-19 dataset using SQL queries. The project involved importing the necessary libraries and dataset, setting up the SQLite database, selecting columns and rows from the data table, filtering data based on specific criteria, using aggregate functions to summarize the data, grouping and filtering groups, sorting data, combining data tables, writing subqueries to refine the data, applying window functions, and visualizing the results using Matplotlib.

[**Netflix Data Cleaning (February 14th, 2025)**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/139d9Wz4gKFJGWEk9LVYPu-VnOEwkTTEb?usp=sharing) 

* In this project, I cleaned a Netflix dataset to prepare it for further analysis. The process involved checking for duplicate rows, handling missing data, ensuring consistent categorical values, and converting date strings into datetime objects. 

[**SQL Queries (February 13th, 2025)**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14V-zfb2khPWpBXZJdGvhL_MmF0uTtUNo?usp=sharing)  

* In this project, I practiced SQL queries on a New York City Airbnb dataset. This included loading the dataset, retrieving all columns from the data table, counting the total records, identifying the ten neighborhoods with the highest Airbnb prices, determining the number of listings by room type, calculating the average number of reviews per listing, finding listings with the minimum number of reviews, filtering listings by neighborhood and maximum price, and closing the cursor and database connection. 

[**Neighborhood Walkability and Health: An Analysis (November 28th, 2024)**](https://github.com/ashgold1027/Neighborhood-Walkability-and-Health-An-Analysis/blob/main/Health_Walkability_Project.ipynb)

* The United States has the highest obesity rate of any country in the world, which may be linked to a lack of walkable environments and car dependency in many areas. This analysis explored whether modifying factors that influence walkability can help reduce obesity and increase physical activity. It also investigated which income and racial demographics would benefit most from such changes. The analysis utilized two datasets from the U.S. government: one on [nutrition, physical activity, and obesity](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nutrition-physical-activity-and-obesity-behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system) and another on [the walkability of U.S. tracts collected in 2013](https://gis.cancer.gov/research/files.html). The findings offer insights that can inform public health initiatives and help target the most vulnerable groups.

[**The Spread of COVID-19 in Scotland (October 28th, 2024)**](https://github.com/ashgold1027/The-Spread-of-Covid-19-in-Scotland/blob/main/The%20Spread%20of%20Covid-19%20in%20Scotland.ipynb) 

* This project analyzed the spread of COVID-19 among different demographic groups in Scotland using real public datasets on COVID-19 transmission and Scottish demographics.
