#Psychology Research Projects 

**Self-Regulation and Procrastination: A New Treatment (will be completed on April 30th)**

* For this dissertation project, I intvented a new treatment that aims to help students decrease procrastination by improving their self-regulation, and I am testing this treatment on first-year psychology students. More specifically, I am comparing how quickly students who received the intervention submit a lab report to students who did not receive the intervention. The psychology students were randomly assigned to each condition, and completed either the intervention or a control condition on a Qualtrics survey. Later in the semester, a follow-up survey will be administered to collect data on when students submit their lab reports. An independent samples T-test will be conducted with SPSS to test whether there was a significant difference between the average submission date of students who received the intervention and students who did not receive the intervention. My findings will be written into a report and presented to a panel audience.


**Does guided imagery of meaningful places alleviate state anxiety and improve mood? (January 8th)**  

* This research project will be presented at the American Psychological Association's 2025 conference. 

* This research projects tested the effects of guided imagery on anxiety and mood in university students with anxiety. Guided imagery involves beging guided by an audio recording to imagine vivid sensory experiences. The aim of this research project was to test the effects of imagining an urban place versus a natural place, and a place that is meaningful to the participant versus a place that is neutral. We hypothesized that imagining meaningful places, particularly natural ones, would have a greater impact on these measures than imagining neutral places.

* Methodology: Participants completed surveys measuring positive mood, negative mood, and state anxiety before and after the guided imagery task. Linear mixed effects modelling was conducted on SPSS to analyze the quantitative data from these surveys. Participants also answered open-ended questions about their experiences. Template analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data from these questions.

* Results: Results indicated that state anxiety and negative affect decreased significantly in all conditions. However, imagining a neutral place significantly reduced positive affect, while both meaningful conditions had no effect. Qualitative analysis revealed themes of present focus, quieter thoughts, and distraction from stress, as well as challenges completing the neutral place condition.

* Conclusion: These findings did not support the hypothesis that meaningful natural places would have the greatest effects on state anxiety and affect. This suggests that the therapeutic effects on state anxiety and negative affect may stem from the guided imagery task itself, rather than the type of imagined place.

  

# Data Science Projects 

**COVID-19 Data Visualization (March 6th, 2025)**  

* In this project, I explored and visualized data on COVID-19, including vaccination rates, infection rates, and death counts. I used Pandas to summarize the data with descriptive statistics, and used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize trends and identify patterns. From the visualizations I made, I observed that Western European countries had higher mortality rates than Eastern European countries, and that the United States had the largest number of active COVID-19 cases by far of any country in the Americas. Based on these insights, future research can investigate whether there are differences in healthcare systems, policies, and other variables that contribtue to the higher number of active COVID-19 cases in the United States and the higher mortality rate in Western Europe. 

**SQL for Epidemiology (February 18th, 2025)**

* In this project, I analyzed a COVID-19 dataset using SQL queries. This involved importing the libraries and dataset, setting up the SQLite database, selecting columns and rows from the data table, filtering data to fit certain criteria, using aggregate functions to summarize the data, grouping data and filtering groups, sorting data, combining data tables, writing subqueries to further refine the data, using window functions to perform operations on the data, and creating a visualization with Matplotlib. 

**Netflix Data Cleaning (February 14th, 2025)** 

* In this project, I cleaned a set of Netflix data to prepare it for further analysis. This involved checking the dataset for duplicate rows, handling missing data, ensuring that categorical values are entered in consistently, and converting dates from string objects to datetime objects. 
  
**SQL Queries (February 13th, 2025)**  

* In this project, I practiced SQL queries on a New York City Airbnb dataset. This involved Loading the dataset, retrieving all of the columns from the datatable, counting the total records, finding the ten neighborhoods with the highest Airbnb prices, finding the number of listings by room type, finding the average number of of reviews per listing, finding listings with the minimum number of reviews, filtering listings by neighborhood and maximum price, and closing the cursor and database connection. 

**Neighborhood Walkability and Health: An Analysis (November 28th, 2024)**  

* The United States of America has the highest amount of obesity of any country in the world. The U.S. is also notorious for having towns that lack walkability and are reliant on cars instead. The goal of this data analysis was to investigate whether factors that influence an environmentâ€™s walkability can be changed to help reduce obesity and increase physical activity, and then to discover which income and race demographics would benefit the most from these changes. This analysis can inform possible intiatives to improve public health and help us know which groups to target these initiatives to. Two sets of data were used for this analysis, both of which were collected by the U.S. government. One data table is about the nutrition of various demographics in the U.S. (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nutrition-physical-activity-and-obesity-behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system), and the other data table is on the walkability of each tract of the U.S. (https://gis.cancer.gov/research/files.html). The walkability data was collected in 2013.

**The Spread of COVID-19 in Scotland (October 28th, 2024)** 

* This is an analysis on the spread of Covid-19 among different demographics in Scotland. This analysis was conduced on real public datasets on the spread of covid and Scottish demographics.
