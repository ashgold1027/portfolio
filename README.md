### Projects 

COVID-19 Data Visualization (March 6th, 2025)  

* In this project, I explored and visualized data on COVID-19, including vaccination rates, infection rates, and death counts. I used Pandas to summarize the data with descriptive statistics, and used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize trends and identify patterns. From the visualizations I made, I observed that Western European countries had higher mortality rates than Eastern European countries, and that the United States had the largest number of active COVID-19 cases by far of any country in the Americas. Based on these insights, future research can investigate whether there are differences in healthcare systems, policies, and other variables that contribtue to the higher number of active COVID-19 cases in the United States and the higher mortality rate in Western Europe. 

SQL for Epidemiology (February 18th, 2025)  

* In this project, I analyzed a COVID-19 dataset using SQL queries. This involved importing the libraries and dataset, setting up the SQLite database, selecting columns and rows from the data table, filtering data to fit certain criteria, using aggregate functions to summarize the data, grouping data and filtering groups, sorting data, combining data tables, writing subqueries to further refine the data, using window functions to perform operations on the data, and creating a visualization with Matplotlib. 

Netflix Data Cleaning (February 14th, 2025) 

* In this project, I cleaned a set of Netflix data to prepare it for further analysis. This involded checking the dataset for duplicate rows, handling missing data, ensuring that categorical values are entered in consistently, and converting dates from string objects to datetime objects. 
  
SQL Queries (February 13th, 2025)   

* In this project, I practiced SQL queries on a New York City Airbnb dataset. This involved Loading the dataset, retrieving all of the columns from the datatable, counting the total records, finding the ten neighborhoods with the highest Airbnb prices, finding the number of listings by room type, finding the average number of of reviews per listing, finding listings with the minimum number of reviews, filtering listings by neighborhood and maximum price, and closing the cursor and database connection.
