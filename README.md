### Projects 

COVID-19 Data Visualization (March 6th, 2025)  

* In this project, I explored and visualized data on Covid-19, including vaccination rates, infection rates, and death counts. I used Pandas to summarize the data with descriptive statistics, and used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize trends and identify patterns. From the visualisations I made, I observed that Western European countries had higher mortality rates than Eastern European countries, and that the United States had the largest number of active Covid-19 cases by far of any country in the Americas. Based on these insights, future research can investigate whether there are differences in healthcare systems, policies, and other variables that contribtue to the higher number of active covid cases in the United States and the higher mortality rate in Western Europe.
